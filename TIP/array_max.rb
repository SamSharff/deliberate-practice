# Write a function that returns the greatest value from an array of numbers.

# Input: [5, 17, -4, 20, 12]
# Output: 20

# Input: []
# Output: "No value given"

# Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
# Output: 4

# FOCUS
# while loop and each loop
#   while loop is most flexible
#     con: manage your own index, i = 0
#   each loop --> popular in working environment, you know you need to go through each element in the array 
#   map loop --> also popular; go through every element and, for example, add 1 (don't worry for whiteboarding)

# Visualize
# create a function
# create a loop (while here to start)
# start with index 0
# create variable max, set to array[0]
# look at next number and compare to variable max. if that number is larger, set variable max to that new number; if it's equal to, just skip and keep going through array until you get to the last number.
# if empty array, return "No value given"
# after loop complete, return variable max
# print sample cases when testing to show edge cases work
